# buddy_ninja-_test
to run:
<pre><code>```
  docker-compose up --build
```</code></pre>

The mock data itself was sent to the server using c, the server was done using golang echo library and the frontend was done via next js.
If it was a full on project and not one done for a test I would have used something like thingspeak and maybe more native esp32 libraries like httpclient isntead of curl as this was done natively on my machine
